I would say that the doublerInsert function is O(n) because it seems to increase in time at a pretty 
constant rate as the size of the array increases. It may not be a perfect line but it is mostly 
constant. Whereas I would say that doublerAppend is O(log n) because it starts off by 
running slower than doublerInsert but as the size of array increases to larger numbers it eventually 
starts to run faster with no signs that it is going to increase again. This being said it looks to me 
like the doublerAppend scales better for large amounts of data.
